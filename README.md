# React-Native-Codepush
A codepush sample 

Last time the repo was working properly I was using these software versions:

Node JS Version: 16.14.0 <br />
React-native-cli: 2.0.1 <br />
React-native: 0.70.6 <br />
XCode: 14.2 

## Android 

*Still in progress*

## iOS

Clone the project to a desired folder.

Open a terminal and go to the root project folder and go to the ios folder. 

Run: `pod install`

Go back to the root folder of the project, open an iOS simulator (You can run the iOS simulator without XCode by going to the Finder, pressing Command + Shift + G and typing the next path /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app)

Finally, when the simulator is open, just run: `npm run ios`
